- In your installation directory, clone your local computer, the package: <b>[<b>spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access</b>](https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/tree/main) ©</b> 
- Change your current directory to <b>/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access</b>
- Install the required node packages, <b>npm -install</b>
- Next install the text menu driven system as follows:
    - execute the following command: <b>'. ./scripts/setupEnvAlises.sh</b>'
- <b>Notes:
    - This installation assumes operation under command window bash or gitBash for windows</b>
    - The Menu System modifies the ~/.bashrc file to add an environment path link
 - - - - 
### Environment Setup<img src="https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spCoinImages/blob/main/setup6.png" width="7%" align= "right">
- Now we will setup the menu alises for testing the sponsor coin project through hardhat.
- From a linux command windrow, run the menu script <b>. ./scripts/setupEnvAlises.sh</b> from the projects home directory <b>spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access</b>.
- Typing <b>m</b> will display a list of menu shortcut alias commands.
- A sample configuration file <b>"[<b>.env</b>](https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/blob/main/.e/SAMPLE.env)"</b> exists in  project's home directory <b>/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/.e/SAMPLE.env</b>.
- Create an account on <b>"[<b>ALCHEMY</b>](https://auth.alchemy.com/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.alchemy.com)"</b>. And get your free <b>ALCHEMY</b> Network access keys.
- Create an account on <b>"[<b>INFURA</b>](https://app.infura.io/login)"</b>. And get your free <b>INFURA</b> Network access keys.
- Copy the sample file <b>/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/.e/SAMPLE.env</b> to <b>/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/.env</b>.
- This file, <b>"[<b>.env</b>]"</b> requires your keys from above to be added for block chain network access.
- Further environment settings exist in the file <b>/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/env/.e</b>.
 - - - - 
### Command Menu Shortcuts<img src="https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spCoinImages/blob/main/menu 4.jpg" width="7%" align= "right">
The <b>All Command Menus</b> are a list of shortcut alias commands for administering the [<b>'spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access'</b>](https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/blob/main/.e/.a) project.
- If the menu system is installed correctly, simply type short cut alias <b>'m \<enter>'</b> in a bash window and the following should appear:
- - - - 
#### The Main Menu
![<b>Author Image</b>](https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spCoinImages/blob/main/mainMenu.jpg)
The above menu is simply a menu of many submenus. Each entry is an alias to an alternate command menu short cut. Each submenu exists under the repositories’ spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/env directory. These menus cane be more completely described in the file [<b>./setupEnv/ReadMe.md</b>](https://github.com/sponsorCoinAdmin/spCoinSetupEnv/blob/main/README.md).
- - - - 
#### Running Your First Test Through the Menu
- Menu test example, running run alias command <b>"hhtest</b> which is defined as alias hhtest='sethh; reset;clear; npx hardhat test 2>&1 | tee ./test.out/hhtest.out'"</b>
- Type hhtest <return>
- This command starts a hardhat server, deploys spCoin on the server, runs a test and dumps the output to directory file <b>"sponsorCoinAdmin/spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access/test.out/hhtest.out"</b>
- - - - 
#### Hardhat localhost Server Setup
- HardHat is a network access server for implementing and testing contracts using Javascript Node.
- It is recommended to use a linux based command window such as bash or git bash.
- Videos are available as a tutorial starter on this site.<b> YET TO COME???</b>.
- Open up a bash window and start the server with the command <b>npx hardhat node</b>
- - - - 
#### Remix Website IDE Setup
- Remix is a browser based Solidity contract ide required to edit test and/or deploy contracts to a specified network.
- In the browser of your choice, enter the URL <b>https://remix.ethereum.org/</b>
- Videos are available as a tutorial starter on this site.
- Change directory to the project directory <b>spcoin-hardhat-contracts-ts-access</b> and start the source workspace server by typing <b>remixd</b>
- In the Remix page on the browser select <b>File Explorer</b> and open <b>Local File System</b> the directory should be loaded.
- Start the HardHAt server with the command <b>npx hardhat node &</b> which should start up ad hardhat server endpoint at <b>http://127.0.0.1:8545</b>.
